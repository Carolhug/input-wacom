This kernel driver package is to support Wacom devices on kernels 2.6.26 and later.
For serial ISDV4 devices, an utility, inputattach, is needed to map the driver to a
logical port for user land to access. Please refer to the README under inputattach
for details.

The paired X server Wacom driver is xf86-input-wacom. If you are not running the
latest xf86-input-wacom, please download it from linuxwacom.sf.net.
