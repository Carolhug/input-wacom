inputattach is to provide /dev/input/event, an USB-like logical port, for Wacom
serial ISDv4 digitizers on Linux. It requires wacom_w8001.ko being loaded in your
kernel and the following:

1.	inputattach.c
2.	serio-ids.h: a header file for inputattach.c to compile on different platforms.
3.	compile the code:  gcc inputattach.c -o inputattach

Procedures to test the driver and device:
1.	login to yourself and switch to root then issue:
	xxd /dev/ttyS0 and move Wacom pen on the tablet.
If you see data displays on the terminal where you launched xxd, this is the 
port the device is mapped to. If not, try ttyS1, 2,.... I see ttyS4 sometime. 
We assume it is on /dev/ttyS0 from now on.

2.	ls /dev/input and keep a note on how many events you see. We need the 
largest number later.

3.	Connect your serial kernel driver to an input event by:
	./inputattach --wacom /dev/ttyS0  (if your device is at baud rate 19200)
or
	./inputattach --wacom-384 /dev/ttyS0  (if your device is at baud rate 38400)
4.	Check which port it is mapped to by:
	ls /dev/input	
You should see a new /dev/input/event# added in the above output, that is the port 
your device is mapped to. Now you can view the data from the port by evtest or some 
other programs. If you have X server running and you have installed the latest Wacom
X server driver, you should see cursor movement when you move the pen on the tablet now.

Good luck.
